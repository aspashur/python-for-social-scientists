Text Analysis
=============================

Python is a phenomenally good tool for text analysis, and there are a few good tools out there you can use. 

The most used library in social science is probably `the "Natural Language Tool Kit", normally referred to as "NLTK" <http://www.nltk.org/>`_. The library has lots of tools, and is very user friendly. moreover, the site for NLTK not only includes some simple examples on the main page, but `also the full contents of the book "Language Natural Language Processing with Python â€“ Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper <http://www.nltk.org/book/>`_ (talk about generous!). However, if you want a paper copy, you can also find it on `Amazon here <http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Python-Steven/dp/0596516495>`_. 

However, there are some other libraries that are somewhat more powerful, but not as user-friendly. One of the most powerful libraries for Natural Language Processing is the Stanford CoreNLP library. The library itself is not written in Python, but a `number of people have written Python interfaces for the library <http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/extensions.html#python>`_ which you can find here. Again, these are a little harder to use and the documentation is not as good, but they're good options if you run into limitations with NLTK.
