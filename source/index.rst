Welcome to Python for Social Scientists!
========================================================

Python is an increasingly popular tool for data analysis. In recent years, a number of libraries have reached maturity, allowing R and Stata users to take advantage of the beauty, flexibility, and performance of Python without sacrificing the functionality these older programs have accumulated over the years. 

This site is designed to offer an introduction to Python specifically tailored for social scientists -- users with little or no serious programming experience who just want to get things done, and who have experience with programs like R and Stata but are anxious for something better. 

The tutorial starts with directions for getting Python up and running on your computer. Then pick the introduction that best fits your background -- there is :doc:`a page for R users </python_for_r>`, :doc:`a page for Stata users <python_for_stata>`, and :doc:`a page for people who are just getting started <python_for_newbies>`. 

The tutorial then works through a few of the libraries you'll use most: ``pandas`` for working with tabular data (analogous to `data.frames` in R, or everything you ever did in Stata); ``statsmodels`` for econometrics, and ``seaborn`` for graphing. 

In addition, there are also pages for more unusual topics, like :doc:`network analysis using igraph </igraph>` and :doc:`geo-spatial analysis using geopandas </gis>`.

Ready to get started? Head on over to :doc:`Setup </setup>`!
