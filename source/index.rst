Welcome to Python for Social Scientists!
========================================================

Python is an increasingly popular tool for data analysis. In recent years, a number of libraries have reached maturity, allowing R and Stata users to take advantage of the beauty, flexibility, and performance of Python without sacrificing the functionality these older programs have accumulated over the years. 

This site is designed to offer an introduction to Python specifically tailored for social scientists -- users with little or no serious programming experience who just want to get things done, and who have experience with programs like R and Stata but are anxious for something better. 

If you've just landed here, your path depends on your background. If you're an R users, start with the :doc:`Note to R users page </python_for_r>`. If you're a Stata user, start with the :doc:`Note to Stata users page <python_for_stata>`. And if you've never worked with either, head on over to :doc:`Setup <1_setup>` to get started!

The site begins with 4 numbered tutorials I recommend you visit in sequence -- a site for setting up Python on your computer using the Anaconda distribution, an intro to Python for those not familiar with the language, an introduction to the `pandas` library for working with tabular data (analogous to `data.frames` in R, or everything you ever did in Stata), and a guide to installing libraries to expand Python.  

This is followed by a series of "topic" pages, which you should feel free to jump through as appropriate for your purposes: :doc:`statsmodels for econometrics </t_statsmodels>`, :doc:`seaborn </t_seaborn>` for graphing, :doc:`network analysis using igraph </t_igraph>`, :doc:`geo-spatial analysis</t_gis>`, :doc:`ways to accelerate Python </t_super_fast>`, :doc:`big data tools </t_big_data>`.


Ready to get started? Head on over to :doc:`Setup </1_setup>`!
