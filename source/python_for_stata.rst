Note to Stata Users
============================

Welcome Stata users! 

There's good news and bad news for you Stata users (of whom I am definitely one -- I spent 6 years working exclusively in Stata). The goods news is that you have no bad habits developed from R, and you're about to enter a world of phenomenal flexibility and power. 

The main thing to keep in mind during your transition to Python is that there will be things in Python that will frustrate you. The beauty of Stata is that it does one thing, and one thing only: manipulate tabular data-sets. As a result of this narrow focus, Stata is able to develop a very clean, simple, intuitive syntax for that specific application. 

The advantage Python has over Stata is that is can do all sorts of things Stata never could -- network analysis, geo-spatial analysis, web-scraping, text analysis, etc. But the downside is that a side-effect of this flexibility is that Python syntax will feel more cumbersome. That's just a compromise you'll have to decide you can live with if you want to work with Python -- sorry!
