ST: Git and Github
=====================

*STILL IN PROGRESS! Check back for updates* 

What is Git?
--------------
Git is a tool developed to help different people work on anything written in plain-text (usually code of some sort) at the same time without getting in each other's ways. It's not only how big software projects -- both commercial and open-source -- allow people to add and make changes to big projects, it's also increasing a tool for collaboration on things like lessons plans and tutorials. See the links below for more. 

What is GitHub?
----------------

GitHub is a repository where people can host projects that they want other people to be able to contribute to using git. For example, this `entire website is on git <https://github.com/nickeubank/python-for-social-scientists>`_, and if you something here you don't like, you can submit a change on github that, if accepted, will show up here!


Tutorials
-----------
Here are some basic tutorials. 


`Software-Carpentry's Git Tutorial <http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Pre-requisites:** A little experience with command line tools (:doc:`see here </st_command_line>`) is a good idea, but probably even that's not really required.

**The Good:** An open-source tutorial (so people have been refining over and over) written mostly for natural scientists, so NOT software developers. Really nice!

**The Bad:** Not quite as in-depth as you might want if you really want to dive in full-bore. 


`Lynda.com's Git Essential Training <http://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Pre-requisites:** A little experience with command line tools (:doc:`see here </st_command_line>`) is a good idea, but probably even that's not really required.

**The Good:** A really incredibly clear instructor and carefully designed class. Some assumed familiarity with programming, but not a lot. Lynda.com also offers ability to speed-up playback for sections that feel familiar or straightforward. Topics are carefully organized and indexed if you need to jump around. 

**The Bad:** May not be free. Lynda.com tutorials are great because it's a paid service, and sadly you sometimes get what you pay for. However, many universities (Yale, Stanford, etc.) have subscriptions, so check with your institution to see if you can get free access. You can also get a 10 day free trial, or pay $30 for a month. 

In addition, probably MORE depth than almost any of us need, but you can figure out pretty quick what you need.
